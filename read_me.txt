Understanding the Output
Input Details:

The input file output_48000.pcm was recognized as raw PCM audio (pcm_s16le), with a sample rate of 48,000 Hz, stereo channels, and a bitrate of 1536 kb/s.
ffmpeg guessed the channel layout as stereo, which is accurate for the specified format.
Encoding Details:

ffmpeg encoded the audio to Opus format (libopus), with a default bitrate of 96 kbps, since no specific bitrate was set. Opus is a highly efficient codec that provides good audio quality at lower bitrates.
The output file output_48000_test.opus was successfully created with the appropriate metadata.
Output File Details:

The resulting output_48000_test.opus file has a size of 163 kB, and the encoding process maintained the original duration of 10 seconds.
The average bitrate of the output Opus file is approximately 134 kbps, which is typical for Opus files and provides a balance between quality and file size.
Next Steps
Play the Converted Opus File:

You can play the newly created output_48000_test.opus file to verify its audio quality and ensure that it was encoded correctly:
bash
Copy code
ffplay output_48000_test.opus
Or, use VLC:

bash
Copy code
vlc output_48000_test.opus
Compare with the Original Opus File (output_48000.opus):

If the output_48000_test.opus file plays correctly and the original output_48000.opus file does not, it confirms that the issue is with the encoding process in your program.
Review the Opus encoding section in your code to ensure that all parameters (such as sample rate, channels, and buffer sizes) are correctly set and match the expected Opus requirements.
Adjust Encoding Parameters in Your Code:

Ensure you are using opus_encoder_create() and opus_encode() correctly.
Validate the data you pass to these functions, and ensure that error handling is robust and checks for potential encoding errors.
Set Bitrate Explicitly (if Needed):

In ffmpeg, the bitrate is defaulted to 96 kbps, which you can change by specifying the -b:a option, like so:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 48000 -ac 2 -i output_48000.pcm -b:a 128k output_48000_test_128k.opus
This sets the bitrate to 128 kbps for potentially higher quality.

Conclusion
Your ffmpeg test shows that Opus encoding works correctly when handled properly. This indicates that there might be a mistake in your custom encoding logic or buffer management in your program. By reviewing your encoding process and aligning it with successful examples like the ffmpeg conversion, you should be able to resolve the issue and produce valid Opus files.

To play the audio files before encoding (output_48000.pcm) and after decoding (output_48000_decoded.pcm), which are both in raw PCM format, you can use tools like ffplay from FFmpeg or aplay from ALSA. Since these are raw PCM files, you need to specify the audio format parameters (sample rate, channels, and sample format) when playing them.

Playing the Audio Files with ffplay
ffplay is a simple and powerful media player that is part of the FFmpeg suite. To play raw PCM audio files, you need to specify the format using the -f option along with the sample rate (-ar) and number of channels (-ac).

1. Playing the Original PCM Audio (Before Encoding): output_48000.pcm
bash
Copy code
ffplay -f s16le -ar 48000 -ac 2 output_48000.pcm
-f s16le: Specifies the input format as 16-bit signed little-endian PCM.
-ar 48000: Sets the sample rate to 48,000 Hz.
-ac 2: Sets the audio to stereo (2 channels).
2. Playing the Decoded PCM Audio (After Decoding): output_48000_decoded.pcm
bash
Copy code
ffplay -f s16le -ar 48000 -ac 2 output_48000_decoded.pcm
The parameters are the same as the original PCM file since the decoded output should have the same format (16-bit PCM, 48,000 Hz, stereo).
Playing the Audio Files with aplay
aplay is an ALSA sound player that can play raw PCM audio data. You must specify the format, rate, and channels when using aplay.

1. Playing the Original PCM Audio (Before Encoding): output_48000.pcm
bash
Copy code
aplay -f S16_LE -r 48000 -c 2 output_48000.pcm
-f S16_LE: Specifies the format as 16-bit signed little-endian PCM.
-r 48000: Sets the sample rate to 48,000 Hz.
-c 2: Sets the audio to stereo (2 channels).
2. Playing the Decoded PCM Audio (After Decoding): output_48000_decoded.pcm
bash
Copy code
aplay -f S16_LE -r 48000 -c 2 output_48000_decoded.pcm
The parameters remain the same as the original PCM file.
Summary
Use ffplay or aplay with the correct format parameters (-f, -ar, -ac for ffplay and -f, -r, -c for aplay) to play raw PCM audio files.
The audio format (16-bit signed little-endian PCM, 48,000 Hz, stereo) should be the same for both the original and decoded files.
